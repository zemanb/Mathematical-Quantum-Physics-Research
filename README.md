This mathematical quantum mechanics report combined differential equation analysis and complex/linear algebra techniques to study the behavior of quantum particles in a given system. The study analyzed the behavior of the particles through the use of differential equations and utilized complex analysis and functional linear algebra to study the properties of quantum operators and their eigenfunctions. The combination of both techniques allowed for a deeper understanding of the system's behavior, identifying important features and generating valuable insights.
